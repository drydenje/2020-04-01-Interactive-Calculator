CRA app, I was having problems trying to deploy.

It will generate a single image chart to display the effect of compound interest over a specified time, the data it uses is hard coded into the component at the moment.

The helper functions that are used to calculate the savings have unit test associated with them, as does the function that generates the data for the chart.

A simple screenshot is located in the images folder.

Thanks
